@story Patron Authentication Client Credentials PATRON_Specific_And_Global_Account
@created by ssatelle

Narrative:
 As a 3rd Party Application I want to allow a user/patron to enter their Sierra credentials and obtain an API auth code
 that I can use to get an API access token to allow the 3rd Party Application access to the users/patrons data in Sierra
 Then I test that the correct access is assigned. I also test the outcomes when authenticated using client credentials

Scenario: Authenticate as a user with both Patron Specific and Global Patron access then query various patrons accounts
Given my API Server is defined
When I authenticate at /v2/token with credentials i4TOpLg7BapHsZD46Z26gTnPv2qI:QA_API_PATRON_Specific_And_Global_Account
Then I should obtain a JSON AUTH message containing my access_token
When I request data from /v2/patrons/1288667
Then I should get a response of: {
    "id": 1288667,
    "expirationDate": "2015-12-31",
