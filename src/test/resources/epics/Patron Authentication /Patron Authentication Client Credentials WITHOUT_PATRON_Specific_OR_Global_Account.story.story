@story Patron Authentication Client Credentials WITHOUT_PATRON_Specific_OR_Global_Account
@created by ssatelle

Narrative:
 As a 3rd Party Application I want to allow a user/patron to enter their Sierra credentials and obtain an API auth code
 that I can use to get an API access token to allow the 3rd Party Application access to the users/patrons data in Sierra
 Then I test that the correct access is assigned. I also test the outcomes when authenticated using client credentials

Scenario: Authenticate using client credentials as a user with Patron Specific access only then query various patrons accounts - should fail
Given my API Server is defined
When I authenticate at /v2/token with credentials nlQB1yhgpb9iAM2ryCDcdTK+0I8l:QA_API_PATRON_Specific_Account
Then I should obtain a JSON AUTH message containing my access_token
When I make a bad data request from  /v2/patrons/1288667
Then I should get a http error response of 401 Unauthorized
When I make a bad data request from  /v2/patrons
Then I should get a http error response of 401 Unauthorized


Scenario: Authenticate using client credentials as a user with Patron Specific access only then query bibs and items - Should work
Given my API Server is defined

Then I should obtain a JSON AUTH message containing my access_token
