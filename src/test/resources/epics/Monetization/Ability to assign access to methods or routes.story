Narrative:
As a III API developer,
I need the ability to assign API access tier to methods/routes so that libraries can access the appropriate API service tier (Basic or Premium).
@PreReqs:
    Accounts required:
        Account With "Patron Permissions"
        Account without "Patron Permissions" (QA_WITHOUT_PatronPerms)

And my server is configured as a basic install
When I authenticate at /v2/token with credentials <NEED THE CLIENT_KEY>:QA_WITH_PatronPerms
Then I should obtain a JSON AUTH message containing my access_token

Then I should get a response of: {
    "id": 1288667,
    "expirationDate": "2015-12-31",
